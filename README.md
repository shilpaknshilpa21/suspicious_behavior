This project implements a video-based suspicious behavior detection system using Computer Vision and basic NLP reasoning. 
It analyzes uploaded videos to detect human presence, classify actions using pose estimation, infer intent, and generate alerts.

Features

Video upload and processing through a web interface

Human detection using HOG-based person detector

Action recognition using MediaPipe Pose

Frame-level action aggregation

Rule-based intent reasoning (NLP)

Automatic alert generation

Annotated output video with bounding boxes and action labels
